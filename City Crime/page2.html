<h2><u>The body in the apartment</u></h2><br><br><br>
<p>
Detective Jake pulled up to 3:45 in the Old Town,an upscale apartment complex.<br>  A call had come in—Johnson, a 42-year-old investment banker, <br> found dead in his living room.<br>  A single gunshot wound to the chest. No sign of forced entry.<br> <br> 

Jake scanned the crime scene. The front door was locked. <br> A half-drunk cup of coffee sat on the table.<br>  The TV was still on. Beside the victim’s hand—a torn movie ticket stub for ‘Last Night in New York’ (9:30 PM show).<br> <br> 

"Someone was here with him," Jake muttered.
